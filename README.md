# Customer_Analysis_App

# https://investments-customer-analysis.herokuapp.com/

The purpose of this App is to help the Sales and Credit team catch potential future defaulters early on and have a targeted approach to marketing and 
collections efforts with those clients. The nature of our business is to be as all inclusive as possible, thus the name 'National Housing Empowerment Fund'.
Customers are able to purchase plots on payments ranging from 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, and 60 months.
Due to the low barrier of entry, default rates could be harder to predict. That is what led me to build this app so the two teams could create an early watchlist database
of customers. My goal for this app is to ensure that the two teams can now have a targetted approach to their operations.

The App will continue to be updated the more team members use it.
